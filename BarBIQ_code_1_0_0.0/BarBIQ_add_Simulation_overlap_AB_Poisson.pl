#To statistically distinguish the two types of Bar-sequence pairs, a natural co-occurrence of Bar sequences of the same bacterium from an accidental co-occurrence of Bar sequences from different bacteria that existed in the same droplet, we estimated the confidence intervals of the log10(Poisson_Overlap) by simulation. First, we confirmed that for different values of A, B and OD, if the value of log10(AÃ—B) + OD is constant, A=B showed the widest distribution. Therefore, we obtained the distribution of log10(Poisson_Overlap) with a parameter A (=B), which was changed from 1 to 1,500 by 500,000 calculations for every integer using a fixed OD. Then, the one-sided confidence intervals for the distribution were calculated.
